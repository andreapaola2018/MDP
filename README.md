## Getting Started

To clone this repo, run `https://github.com/andreapaola2018/MDP.git`

## Running our Project

In the project directory, you can run:

`python3 main.py <name of algorithm>`

## Features

Given a Markov Decision Process which models the life of a student and the decisions one must make to both have a good time and remain in good academic standing, decision making is simulated by using different basic algorithms for solving MDPs. 


Algorithms for solving MDPs are: Monte Carlo (UR), Value Iteration, and Q-Learning. 

### Monte Carlo
